# HypCompactObjects
by Alex Vano-Vinuales, June 2025.

This repository gathers tools to describe compact objects (neutron stars, black holes, boson stars, etc.) on hyperboloidal slices. It provides supplementary material for paper [arXiv: 2506.05467 [gr-qc]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05467). 

The contained material is the following: 
* Mathematica notebook to create spherically symmetric initial data for a polytropic-like neutron star and for a superposition of neutron star with a black hole in its center.
